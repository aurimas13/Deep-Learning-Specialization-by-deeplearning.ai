# Deep-Learning-Specialization-by-deeplearning.ai (Coursera)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all the courses in the Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization - [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) given by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Notes

### For detailed interview-ready notes on all courses in the Coursera Deep Learning specialization, refer to [www.aman.ai] (https://aman.ai/).

## Setup

Run ```setup.sh``` to (i) download a pre-trained VGG-19 dataset and (ii) extract the zip'd pre-trained models and datasets that are needed for all the assignments.

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.
