# Deep-Learning-Specialization-by-deeplearning.ai (Coursera)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all the courses in the Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization - [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) given by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Notes

### For detailed interview-ready notes on all courses in the Coursera Deep Learning specialization, refer to [www.aman.ai] (https://aman.ai/).

## Setup

Run ```setup.sh``` to (i) download a pre-trained VGG-19 dataset and (ii) extract the zip'd pre-trained models and datasets that are needed for all the assignments.

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.

## Programming Assignments

They are written by me and found in each Course's (C1 to C5) folder except for C3 which did not have any programming assignments.

## Lecture images & notes

Images are screenshoted of the courses by me with unofficial lecture notes gotten from [Mahmoud Badry](https://github.com/mbadry1).

## Disclaimer

I understand the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. So, the solutions uploaded here are ONLY FOR REFERENCE. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. I find that there is no need to copy them as the programming assignments are quite easy once you read the instructions carefully. Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is my first deep learning course I had taken and I enyed it very much. It contains fabulous course content and structure. It's a gift to us from the deeplearning.ai team.
